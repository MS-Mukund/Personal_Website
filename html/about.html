    <pre class="AboutTxt">
                      Hey, I’m Mukund, studying CSE. I've lived my entire life in a small town nearby Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. I can speak only 
      Telugu and English and thoda thoda Hindi (xD).
                      In my free time, I like watching movies (sometimes English, sometimes Telugu). Suspense Thrillers and Comedy are my favorite genres.
      I have also started watching web series lately. I love playing chess (mostly the blitz version) and play it almost like it's an addiction.
      I love pestering people with questions and would like to have friends who are okay with answering them. I am not really an introvert, although 
      I take some time to talk to strangers. I think I do have a sense of humor and like to crack jokes.
                      I love playing basketball. I also play badminton sometimes, volleyball and cricket as well but I'm a beginner in them. I don’t 
      listen to music, but I usually hum some song that have picked up from somewhere. I also like to travel to different places (sadly not possible now)
      and also I am a nature lover. I like movies where the dialogues are well thought out and framed intelligently.
                      I try to meditate for some time every day but my mind simply wanders off. Nevertheless, it brings a certain peace and helps me
      focus better.In my school days, I was very interested in Quizzes and actively took part in many of them (although won in very few). Other than that, 
      I don’t have any major achievements. At first, when I joined the college, I felt a little apprehensive seeing that many of my batchmates are
      great at academics and related stuff, pros in CP, open-source and what-not, but I just got used to it now. I sincerely hope they reopen the campus
      soon and I get to meet my batchmates :)).
